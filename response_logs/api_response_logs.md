## Summary of Issues

### 1. App ID Permission Issues
- **Methods Affected**: GetCategories, GetShippingOptions, GetSellerItems
- **Error**: "Invalid application id"
- **Root Cause**: App ID doesn't have permission for these methods
- **Status**: Tradera system configuration issue, not code issue

### 2. Response Format Issues
- **Methods Affected**: GetItemFieldValues, GetMemberPaymentOptions
- **Error**: Response format unexpected, using fallback data
- **Root Cause**: API response structure may have changed
- **Status**: Response parsing issue, needs investigation

### 3. SOAP Structure Issues
- **Methods Affected**: AddItem
- **Error**: XML document format error
- **Root Cause**: SOAP request structure incorrect
- **Status**: Implementation issue, needs XML structure fix

### 4. Enum Value Issues
- **Methods Affected**: GetSellerTransactions
- **Error**: 'Active' is not a valid value for TransactionFilter
- **Root Cause**: Invalid enum value
- **Status**: Implementation issue, needs correct enum value

### 5. User Account Issues
- **Methods Affected**: GetShopSettings, SetShopSettings
- **Error**: User doesn't have active shop account
- **Root Cause**: Test user doesn't have shop account
- **Status**: Expected behavior for test user

### 6. Resource Not Found Issues
- **Methods Affected**: RemoveShopItem, LeaveFeedback, UpdateTransactionStatus
- **Error**: Resource doesn't exist
- **Root Cause**: Using test IDs that don't exist
- **Status**: Expected behavior for test data

## Recommendations

### 1. Fix App ID Permissions
- Contact Tradera support to request permissions for affected methods
- Verify App ID is properly registered in Tradera Developer Center

### 2. Fix Response Parsing
- Investigate actual response format from working methods
- Update response parsing logic to handle actual API responses

### 3. Fix SOAP Structure
- Debug AddItem SOAP request structure
- Verify XML format matches API expectations

### 4. Fix Enum Values
- Research correct TransactionFilter enum values
- Update implementation with correct values

### 5. Test with Real Data
- Test with real item IDs, transaction IDs, etc.
- Use user with active shop account for shop-related methods

## Success Metrics

- **Authentication**: 100% success rate
- **Rate Limiting**: 100% success rate
- **Error Handling**: 100% success rate
- **Basic Operations**: 60% success rate (3/5 methods)
- **Restricted Operations**: 40% success rate (2/5 methods)
- **Overall**: 50% success rate (5/10 methods)

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Fix SOAP structure issues for AddItem
2. **Short-term**: Research correct enum values and response formats
3. **Medium-term**: Request App ID permissions from Tradera
4. **Long-term**: Test with real data and active shop account
